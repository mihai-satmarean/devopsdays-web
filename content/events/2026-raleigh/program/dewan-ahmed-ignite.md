The fastest way to break trust in DevSecOps is to automate insecurity at scale. As AI takes a central role in our pipelines, it is time to rethink what "secure by default" really means.
In this 5-minute lightning talk, Dewan Ahmed challenges the traditional reliance on vulnerability scanners and compliance gates. He will share a vision for intelligent security by design where native intelligence detects risky delivery behavior, 
such as misconfigured environments and suspicious artifact provenance, before they become breaches.
You will walk away with a high-level framework for balancing automation with human oversight. Learn how to build verifiable, AI-native systems where safety is not just a step but a continuous outcome.

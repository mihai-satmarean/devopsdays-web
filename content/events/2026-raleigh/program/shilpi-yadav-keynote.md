In Large Regulated environments, system outages during deployments can stop important processes, make it harder to follow the rules, and make users lose trust. This webinar talks about tried-and-true zero-downtime deployment techniques that come from genuine modernization programs on hybrid estates. 
We'll talk about practical ways to deploy at scale without stopping business services, like blue-green rollouts, canary waves, dependency sequencing, automated validation, configuration governance, and intelligent rollback triggers. 
Instead of talking about specific technologies, the session focuses on design concepts and what we've learned by working with complicated ERP, API, and integration systems. People who come will get practical advice on how to lower risk, speed up releases, and carry out deployments with confidence, safety, and no downtime.

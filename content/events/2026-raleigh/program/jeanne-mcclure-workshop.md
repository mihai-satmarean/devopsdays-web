 In this hands-on workshop, you'll build a complete LLM-powered system with production-grade observability—from scratch, on your laptop, using entirely open-source tools with zero API costs.
 What you'll build: A document analysis system using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) that can answer questions about your own documents, fully instrumented with tracing and monitoring.

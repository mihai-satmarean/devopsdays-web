I began my career as a digital marketer and web developer before evolving into a global brand builder, sales strategist, and product leader. Over the years, I’ve driven 12+ domestic and global product launches, blending sales-driven 
marketing with innovative growth strategies that deliver measurable ROI. My expertise spans Technology, Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology, Healthcare, Energy, CPG, and more allowing me to adapt go-to-market strategies across diverse industries.
I specialize in high-impact campaigns that generate revenue, accelerate brand growth, and funnel qualified leads into sales pipelines. By aligning marketing, sales, and business development, I ensure strategies drive both customer acquisition and long-term retention.

Beyond business success, I’m passionate about women’s empowerment and mentoring the next generation of female leaders. Fueled by a data-driven mindset, I integrate market intelligence and sales analytics to expand visibility, increase market share, and unlock new opportunities for brands to thrive.

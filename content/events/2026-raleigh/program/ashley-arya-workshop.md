An interactive workshop to discover what hidden work people are doing on their teams and how doing the work that other team members neglect to do actually hurts the team. 
After we discover work that belongs to someone else, we uncover the systemic issues allowing this to happen and draft a script that the person can take back to their managers to make them aware of the situation and get the work realigned.

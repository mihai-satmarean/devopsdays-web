Like many of you, I was raised in the background radiation of Calvinist thought. I expected little but redemptive hard labor, before presumably one day dying in a mine. 
I also read Hackers & Painters at an impressionable age and was kind of a jerk about it for a while. This talk is about how despite this, I got better.

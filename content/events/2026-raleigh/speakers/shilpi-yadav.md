With over 18 years of experience in Enterprise Data Engineering and AI-driven ERP modernization at IBM, and currently working as a Technical Solution Architect, I have been actively contributing to the fields of AI-infused enterprise systems, 
hybrid cloud architectures, and responsible digital transformation. I have also served as a Keynote Speaker and Reviewer at prior international conferences, where I shared insights on Data Engineering topics.

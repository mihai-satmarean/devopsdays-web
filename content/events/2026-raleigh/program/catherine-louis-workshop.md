Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["catherine-louis"]
+++

DevOps is all about collaboration, but it can be challenging to achieve when upper management behaviors create silos that hinder progress. In this talk, we'll explore how to overcome siloed behavior in upper management to ensure DevOps success.
We'll discuss the common siloed behaviors exhibited by upper management, including lack of communication, limited transparency, and resistance to change. We'll also provide strategies for breaking down these silos, including fostering a culture of collaboration, building trust, and encouraging cross-functional teams.

Jeanne McClure, PhD, is a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at NC State's Data Science Academy, where she builds LLM-powered tools and researches systematic approaches to prompt engineering. She developed a comprehensive LLMOps curriculum combining RAG systems, observability, and practical AI engineering. 
Her work focuses on making AI accessible to practitioners—emphasizing local, open-source tools that respect data privacy and eliminate API costs. She created the ICI (Instruction-Context-Input) framework for reliable prompt design and has presented at Voxel51's Women in AI series. 
She's passionate about teaching DevOps practitioners to apply their existing skills to the new world of LLM operations.

Strategy requires choice. No choice? No strategy.

In this session we will explore how to find choices - in architecture, leadership, improvement initiatives, products, and more. Along the way, we will look at how context effects our potential choices and, occassionally, can make an outcome inevitable.
Leave this session understanding how to find more choices, leading you to better strategy.
